# GitHub: Turning a folder into a repo

[TOC]

## Intro

This brief set of instructions describes how to take a pre-existing folder in a GitHub repo and turn it into its own repo.  I'll be using a concrete example based on the following structure:

```
|- Cloud team 

|-|- Brooks

|-|- Keith-Folder 

|-|- Melissa

|-|- Mike
```



## Create a repo in GitHub

Start off by creating a new repo in GitHub with the name of the target folder.  In this example, this will be the **Brooks** folder.
